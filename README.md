# seaborn_statistical_data_visualization_library

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

It provides beautiful default styles and color palettes to make statistical plots more attractive. 

It is built on top matplotlib library and is also closely integrated with the data structures from pandas.

Seaborn aims to make visualization the central part of exploring and understanding data. It provides dataset-oriented APIs so that we can switch between different visual representations for the same variables for a better understanding of the dataset.

### Different categories of plot in Seaborn 
Plots are basically used for visualizing the relationship between variables. 

Those variables can be either completely numerical or a category like a group, class, or division. Seaborn divides the plot into the below categories â€“ 
 
1. Relational plots: This plot is used to understand the relation between two variables.

2. Categorical plots: This plot deals with categorical variables and how they can be visualized.

3. Distribution plots: This plot is used for examining univariate and bivariate distributions

4. Regression plots: The regression plots in Seaborn are primarily intended to add a visual guide that helps to emphasize patterns in a dataset during exploratory data analyses.

5. Matrix plots: A matrix plot is an array of scatterplots.

6. Multi-plot grids: It is a useful approach to draw multiple instances of the same plot on different subsets of the dataset.

Import Seaborn:

import seaborn as sns
